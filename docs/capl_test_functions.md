## Test Structuring

|  | Note
                                        The user can display structured data in the test report. The data is formatted as a table that can contain multiple rows and columns.
                                        A header row can be specified by the function TestInfoHeadingBegin and TestInfoHeadingEnd. Other table rows can be specified by the function TestInfoRow. A row and a header row can be divided into multiple columns using the function TestInfoCell.
                                        The content of the table will be displayed using one of the test step functions: TestStep, TestStepPass, TestStepFail, TestStepWarning. |
